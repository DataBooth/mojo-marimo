# 🎯 Feedback Requested!

**This is a work-in-progress** released specifically for community feedback. I'm particularly interested in:

## Pattern Preferences
- **Which pattern** do you prefer and why?
- **Decorator** (simple, notebook-friendly) vs **Extension modules** (zero overhead)?
- Is the extension module complexity worth the performance gain?

## Use Cases
- What **real-world problems** would you solve with this?
- Algorithm prototyping? Production notebooks? Education?
- Where does the subprocess overhead (~10-50ms) become a bottleneck?

## API & Ergonomics
- Is the `{{param}}` template syntax intuitive?
- Should we auto-generate extension module boilerplate?
- Missing features or documentation?

## Performance
- Observations on your hardware?
- Benchmarks that would be valuable?
- Edge cases or bugs?

**All feedback welcome** - issues, PRs, or comments!
